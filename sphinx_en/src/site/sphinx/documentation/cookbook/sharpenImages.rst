How to obtain sharper images in ARender
=======================================

By default, internet browsers smooth out the displayed pictures to make webpages more comfortable to browse.

If you wish to find by a look alike effect of Adobe Reader, which does not smoothen the pictures, it is now possible in ARender to deactivate this smoothening. 

The parameter to modify is the following:  

*visualization.images.sharpen* and set it to *true* in ARender profiles.

Example before sharpening : 

.. image:: /_static/images/blurry.png

Example with sharpening : 

.. image:: /_static/images/unblurry.png

Comparison with Adobe at approximately the same zoom level:

.. image:: /_static/images/adobePixel.png

We see with this small text comparison that the rendering is becoming very look alike of Adobe Reader look and feel for text. If your user base is used to this software, you might wanna turn this paramter on.

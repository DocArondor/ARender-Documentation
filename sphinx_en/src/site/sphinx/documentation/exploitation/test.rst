Normal behaviour tests
----------------------

This chapter is meant to check if ARender is working as expected. The tests can be performed on a punctual basis (install, upgrade, etc) as well as continuously to supervise.

Rendition server 
================

Testing the rendition server by using the test provided by ARender is recommended. The test can validate the two main aspects. First, test the communication using the Remote Method Invocation protocol, this can also be done remotely using the « -d » parameter. Ce dernier permet de spécifier l’hôte distant (à suffixer par JavaRMIDocumentService). Validation of the rendered document is the second aspect.

Presentation server
===================

To test the presentation application, you just need to use the ARender.html web page this can be done using the wget tool.

End to end
==========

Depending on needs, different level of test can be set-up. As a matter of fact, end to end test can be done to test the application as a whole. Typically, HTTP GEt requests can be used to test the opening of a document and its rendition.

* Step 1 : Using an URL to load a document ::

    http://arender.fr/ARender/openExternalDocument.jsp?url=http://arender.arondor.com/pdf/pdf/fw4.pdf

This JSP page will return ARender's ID of the fw4.pdf document. 

You can also provide to this JSP any usual URL parameter, ARender is able to use every single connector.

* Step 2 : Loading page test ::

    http://arender.fr/ARender/arendergwt/imageServlet?uuid=${id ARender}&pagePosition=1&desc=IM_800_0

This servlet is made to test the generation of a 800px pictures of page one from document ${id ARender}

*Nota : In case of complex architecture, this methodology won't be able to test every branches of the platform.  Typically, If a rendition farm is defined, it's not possible, using this, to ensure both rendition server have been tested.*

Backup / Restore
----------------

Rendition server
================

Backing up a rendition server is just the simple copie of the installation folder. This can be done while the server running as well as when it's shutdown.

To save space the *tmp* folder can be overlooked. The *tmp* folder is storing open documents when the server is running.

Restoring a rendition server is done in two steps : 

* Installation restoration : Copy the backed-up folder. 

* service restoration : Copying the file doesn't change the service created on the operating system.

To restore, execute the following script :

* Windows ::
    
    bin/InstallService-ARenderServer.bat

* Linux ::

    bin/ARenderServer.sh install

If the service has already been installed, you need to delete it :

* Windows ::

    bin/UninstallService-ARenderServer.bat

* Linux ::

    bin/ARenderServer.sh remove
    
Presentation server
===================

To back-up a presentation server you need : 

* The deployed web application (WAR or EAR)

* Application server's configuration (if not default)

* Various elements (configuration files, librairies...) remote (if any)

Restoring a presentation server require the web application to be deployed, configuration files and remote elements.

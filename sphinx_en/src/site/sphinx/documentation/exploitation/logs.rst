Logs
----

ARender's two distinct entities each store their own logs using framework Log4j.

This framework's online documentation available : `here <http://logging.apache.org/>`_.

Rendition server
================

Two files can be found in the log folder inside the install folder :

* The first file wrapper.log keeps trace of starting and stopping events of ARenderService. It can be configured using the wrapper.conf file (in the conf folder inside the install folder).

* The second file *arender-rendition-server.log* keeps trace of every single events happening during the use of the rendition server. It can be configured using the *log4j.properties* (in the conf folder inside the install folder).

Presentation server
===================

Tasks such as annotation or access to a document can be tracked down. Log4j library can also be used. This library can be configured using the configuration file *log4j.properties* located in the *WEB-INF\classes* folder of the WEB app to be deployed.

Depending on the needs, the configuration file can be stored remotely or overloading it on the application server.

On default settings, only « Warning » traces are kept on the application server's log.  A second appender (« Viewer ») is provided in order to store logs in an other file the the application server's.
